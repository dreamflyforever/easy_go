### easy_go
This is an easily customizable makefile template. The purpose is to 

provide an instant building environment for C/C++ programs.
It searches all the C/C++ source files in the specified directories,
makes dependencies, compiles and links to form an executable.

Besides its default ability to build C/C++ programs which use only
standard C/C++ libraries, you can customize the Makefile to build
those using other libraries. Once done, without any changes you can
then build programs using the same or less libraries, even if source
files are renamed, added or removed. Therefore, it is particularly
convenient to use it to build codes for experimental or study use.

GNU make is expected to use the Makefile. Other versions of makes
may or may not work.
